This project created during the learning process

I wrote kotlin part 
(Connect Four -> task -> src/connectfour)

Connect Four is a fun game for two players. 
Players take turns placing discs on a vertical 
board. The goal of the game is to be the first 
to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal 
line of four discs. 

Typically, the game board has 6 rows and 7 
columns, but in this version, the number of 
rows and columns can vary from 5 to 9.

After setting the board dimensions, the 
program asks the players if they would like 
to play a single or multiple games. In the 
latter case, the program keeps and prints 
the score. When a player wins a game, they 
get 2 points. If it's a draw, 1 point to each 
player.

At any point of the game, if players input 
end, the program outputs "Game over!" and 
terminates the game.
